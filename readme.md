# DESCRIPTION

A browser rendition of the classic arcade game, Snake, implemented using jQuery and Javascript. It features multiple levels of difficulty and a local highscore system.

# DIRECTIONS

Simply use the arrow keys on the keyboard to steer the snake in the direction you want and eat the apples in order to grow longer. Each apple counts as a single point. You can use the 'P' key to pause the game and return to it at a later time. :)
